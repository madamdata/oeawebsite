	How this works: <br>
	1. You bring in a piece of gear. We will do a quick inspection and discuss the problem with you for free. If we are able to make an immediate diagnosis there and then, we will waive the diagnosis fee.<br>
	2. If the gear requires an extended diagnosis, we will keep it and charge a diagnosis fee based on the table below.<br>
	3. Once a diagnosis has been made, we will contact you to discuss what work needs to be done. This work will be charged per hour based on the 'Labour Fees' table below and <i> does not include the cost of replacement parts.</i> <br><br>

	All prices are in SGD, and are <a href='#whyslidingscale'>sliding scale</a> - any amount in the stated range is acceptable. Fees are payable on return of the items.<br>
	If you are unable to afford anything, please contact us and we will work something out.<br>

	<p><h3>Why sliding scale fees?</h3>
	<div class='segmentBlock'>
	1. &nbsp;We want our services to be accessible to the broadest range of people possible, regardless of their ability to pay. <br>
	2. &nbsp;Sliding scale fees emphasize that by paying us, you are not simply transacting for a service - you are choosing to support our flourishing and investing in the communities we are part of. We believe that people should be given what they need to survive regardless of their ability to work: that is the world we want to live in.
